Code for [http://play.elevatorsaga.com](http://play.elevatorsaga.com).

This solution got through level 6 (barely).

Areas for Improvements:

* sorting / prioritzation on the ```this.getPressedFloors()``` array.   
* Isn't DRY; functionality needs to be pulled out into.. well functions. 
* Not taking advantage of much of the API -- hadn't really gotten the floors up/down pushes rquests going, etc.
